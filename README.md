# parkingkorkor

**NUS Orbital 2023 – Milestone 1**

**Proposed Level of Achievement:** 

Apollo 11

**Project Motivation:**

What do young adults do when they first get their driver’s license? You’re right, they go out for a drive. Being young adults ourselves, we have found ourselves in similar situations. Perhaps it is to run errands during the day, or to drive to dinner with friends, one thing is sure, drivers need to find a place to park.

Parking can get complicated very quickly. Especially for the budget-conscious and time-conscious folk, balancing between various factors when deciding where to park can be challenging. 

**Aim:**

Parkingkorkor will be a web-based application that serves as a platform for drivers to get up-to-date information about carparks in the vicinity of their selected destination, such as the number of lots, price, and distance to their final destination.

Inspired by the similarly titled “RainKorKor” bot popular on Telegram, Parkingkorkor sees itself as an accessible way for drivers to get information to better plan their journeys.

**User Stories:**

1\. As a budget-conscious driver, I want to know where I can park at the most affordable rate near my destination without spending too much time researching.

2\. As a forward-thinking driver, I want to know that the car park I am travelling to has lots available, and where the alternative parking spaces are if the car park is full.

3\. As a frequent driver, I want to be able to search for available parking spots in real time so that I can find a convenient location to park my car without wasting time driving around.

4\. As a student, I want to be able to compare parking prices in different areas so that I can find the most affordable option near my school.
