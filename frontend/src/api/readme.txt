chatgpt says that this directory is to be used as such:

With the api directory created, you can now start adding files 
for handling backend requests.
For example, you can create a file called users.js 
inside the api directory to handle user-related API calls.

Open the users.js file in your code editor, 
and you can begin defining the functions that will make 
HTTP calls to your Django backend.
Repeat the process for other API endpoints or resources as 
needed, creating new files within the api directory.
